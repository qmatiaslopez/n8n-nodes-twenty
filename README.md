## Credentials

Generate an API key in Twenty by following the [Twenty docs](https://twenty.com/developers). In summary, create an API key in the Settings ‚Üí Playground section.

Copy the API key. Click 'Add Credential' in n8n and search for 'Twenty API'. Provide the API key and your Twenty domain (e.g. http://localhost:3000, https://app.twenty.com). Do _not_ include the API path - the node will automatically use the correct endpoints.

## Compatibility

**BREAKING CHANGE:** This version requires Twenty v1.4.0 or later. For older versions of Twenty, use n8n-nodes-twenty v0.0.5 instead.

Compatible and tested with Twenty v1.4.0 and n8n v1.91.3+.
